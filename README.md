# hylo-redux
Experimental version of the Hylo.com frontend, written with React and Redux.

## Goals

* universal rendering
  * reduce client-side effort and wait time when loading the site for the first time, as in the common case of responding to an email or push notification
  * support Facebook sharing with Open Graph meta tags more easily

* client-side caching
  * more responsiveness and less network activity

* better management of complexity
  * as always: less coupling, more adaptability

## Usage

Use node ^5.6.0.

For local development, create a file named `.env` in the project root:

```
LIVERELOAD=true
PORT=9000
UPSTREAM_HOST=http://localhost:3001
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

Create a file named `.env.test` with the same contents, except with `LOG_LEVEL` changed to `warn`, to reduce noise when running tests.

Then it's just the usual: `npm install`, `npm start`, `npm test`.

It depends on a running instance of [hylo-node](https://github.com/Hylozoic/hylo-node), the location of which is set with `UPSTREAM_HOST`.

## Deployment

The deployment code should probably be pulled out into a separate module at some point.

Create a file named `.env.deploy` in the project root, or get the variables below into your environment otherwise:
```
HEROKU_API_TOKEN=some_token
HEROKU_APP_NAME=some_app_name
```
The specified token should be one that has access to the specified app.

To deploy, first run `gulp deploy`. This will:
* Read environment variables from the Heroku app specified above (see [loadHerokuEnv.js](https://github.com/Hylozoic/hylo-redux/blob/master/tasks/loadHerokuEnv.js) for the list)
* Write a Javascript bundle to `dist/`, using the environment variables from the app
* Copy all images from `public/` to `dist/`
* Write a CSS bundle to `dist/`
* Suffix all filenames in `dist/` with hashes based on their contents using [gulp-rev](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-rev)
* Upload the files to S3 (the credentials for which are also fetched from the Heroku environment)
* Set `SOURCE_VERSION` on the Heroku app to be the first 8 characters of the current commit hash (the app uses this to determine which set of uploaded assets to use)

Then run `git push heroku master` to deploy the most recent code.
